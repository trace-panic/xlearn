# Introduction to the Command Line

## What is the Shell?

The shell is your gateway to the Linux system - it's a program that accepts keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system for execution. While graphical interfaces make computing more accessible, the shell gives you direct, powerful control over your system.

### Types of Shells

- **bash** (Bourne Again Shell) - Default on most Linux systems
- Others include:
  - ksh (Korn Shell)
  - zsh (Z Shell)
  - tcsh (TC Shell)

This course focuses on bash, as it's the most commonly used shell.

## Understanding the Shell Prompt

The standard bash prompt follows this format:

```bash
username@hostname:current_directory$
```

Components:
- `username{:bash}`: Your login name
- `hostname{:bash}`: Your computer's name
- `current_directory{:bash}`: Your current location in the filesystem
- `${:bash}`: Indicates a regular user (root users see `#{:bash}` instead)

## Tips for Using the Shell

1. Use Tab completion to:
   - Save typing
   - Avoid spelling mistakes
   - Quickly explore options

2. Access command history:
   - Up/Down arrows for previous commands
   - `history{:bash}` command to see all
   - `Ctrl+R{:bash}` for history search

3. Common keyboard shortcuts:
   - `Ctrl+C{:bash}`: Cancel current command
   - `Ctrl+L{:bash}`: Clear screen
   - `Ctrl+A{:bash}`: Move to start of line
   - `Ctrl+E{:bash}`: Move to end of line

We will now go over each command in details from the next session

# Understanding `pwd{:bash}` and Linux File System

## The Linux File System

In Linux, everything is organized as a file within a hierarchical directory structure. This structure starts at the root directory (represented by `/{:bash}`) and branches out into other directories.

### Basic File System Structure

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="/" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="bin/" />
    <FileTree.File name="etc/" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="home/" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="user1/" />
      <FileTree.File name="user2/" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="var/" />
    <FileTree.File name="usr/" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## The `pwd{:bash}` Command

### Basic Usage

```bash
pwd
# Output example: /home/username
```

The `pwd{:bash}` command ("print working directory") shows your current location in the filesystem.

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-L` | Show logical path (follows symbolic links) |
| `-P` | Show physical path (shows actual path) |

```bash
# Logical path (default)
pwd -L

# Physical path
pwd -P
```

## Understanding Paths

### Absolute Paths
- Start from the root directory (/)
- Always begin with a forward slash
- Complete path to location

Examples:

```bash
/home/username
/etc/firefox
/var/log
```

### Relative Paths
- Start from current location
- Don't begin with a forward slash
- Use special notations:
  - `.{:bash}` (current directory)
  - `..{:bash}` (parent directory)

Examples:

```bash
# If you're in /home/username
Documents/Photos    # Points to /home/username/Documents/Photos
../otheruser       # Points to /home/otheruser
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Script Navigation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
current_dir=$(pwd)
echo "Working from: $current_dir"
```

### 2. Path Verification

```bash
# Check if in correct directory
if [ "$(pwd)" != "/home/username/project" ]; then
    echo "Wrong directory!"
fi
```

### 3. Building File Paths

```bash
base_dir=$(pwd)
config_file="$base_dir/config.txt"
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Always Verify Location**
   - Use `pwd{:bash}` before executing important commands
   - Especially important when using `rm{:bash}` or `mv{:bash}`

2. **Path Names**
   - Avoid spaces in directory names
   - Use underscores or hyphens instead

3. **Working with Paths**
   - Store current path when scripting
   - Use absolute paths for important scripts

Understanding your location in the filesystem is fundamental to Linux navigation. Next, we'll learn how to change directories using the `cd{:bash}` command.

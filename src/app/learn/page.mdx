# Introduction to Linux

Welcome to the world of Linux! XLearn will guide on this exciting journey. Let's start with understanding what Linux is and how it came to be.

## Historical Background

### The UNIX Origins (1969)
- Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories developed UNIX
- Later rewritten in C programming language for better portability

## Linux System Architecture

A Linux system consists of three main components:

1. **Hardware Layer**
   - Physical components (CPU, memory, disks)
   - Input/output devices

2. **Linux Kernel**
   - Core of the operating system
   - Manages hardware resources
   - Facilitates hardware-software communication

3. **User Space**
   - Where users interact with the system
   - Applications and user interfaces
   - Command-line tools and utilities
